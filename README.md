# ERC-721 Tests

Test cases for [ERC-721 implemented in Yul](https://github.com/humayunj/NFT-contract-the-hard-way) to make sure it's ERC-721 specs and ABI compliant. Tests taken from [here](https://github.com/nibbstack/erc721/blob/master/src/tests/tokens/nf-token.js) and modified a bit (reverts with specific strings removed and non-spec "burn" tests removed). Contract in test cases is deployed using its bytecode and ABI.
